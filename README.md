# Airfare Rates in the US, 1995 - 2021

This project is in progress. 

## About

This project is to compare airfare prices overall trends from 1995 to 2021, then focus on the differences between Q1 of 2020 and 2021. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound effect on domestic travel in the U.S. The restrictions on travel guidelines and procedures left many airplanes flying empty of passengers.[^1] Consumers could plainly see that the price of airfare was falling.

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics refers to the months of January 1 - March 31 as Q1. 

- The first U.S. citizen to test positive for COVID-19 occurred on January 21, 2020.[^2]
- On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization officially "declared COVID-19 a global pandemic."[^3] 
- California became the first state to issue a "Shelter at Home" order on March 19, 2020.[^4] 
- The first quarter of 2020, while not uneffected by the pandemic, was less effected than the remainder of the year.[^5]
- Q1 of 2021 had record-high new cases in January, and while declining by March 31, the new cases never fell to the highest recorded new cases in Q1 of 2020.[^6]

I would like to explore how Q1 of 2020, with few cases and restrictions for most of the quarter, compares to Q1 of 2021, with several new cases and restrictions for the duration of the quarter. 

**Questions:**

* Did the rates in 2021 deviate from overall trends of the previous 25 years?
* How do 2020 and 2021 differ?
* Do we see a difference in prices from all airports?

**Average Fares Examined in this report:**
1. Prices adjusted for inflation, 1995 - 2021
2. All US Airports, from Q1 (January - March) reports, 2020 and 2021
3. 100 Busiest US Airports, from Q1 (January - March) reports, 2020 and 2021
4. Five Busiest US Airports, from Q1 (January - March) reports, 2020 and 2021
